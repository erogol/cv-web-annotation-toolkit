= Server parts =

== Admin interface ==

Admin URL: http://128.174.241.84:8080/admin/

Built-in admin interface allows to add users, groups and permissions. The admin interface allows to see and edit any data item as it is stored in the database. *Datasets* and *Annotation types* can be edited using admin interface.

== Annotation display  ==

 * Browsing images: http://128.174.241.84:8080/datastore/data/VOC2008/
 * Browsing a single image annotations: http://128.174.241.84:8080/datastore/dataitem/3/
 * Single annotation display: http://128.174.241.84:8080/datastore/show/annotation/3/

In the image browsing mode, the images are displayed 20 per page. Each image has a link to see the annotations associated with it. The annotations for the image are grouped by the type. Each annotation is displayed separately.  A link (">>") goes to the detailed view of this annotation. "(+)" marks annotations with extra annotations attached to them (e.g. with quality judgments or comments).

Add annotations link goes to the page to add a new annotation. 

Any annotation allows to add a quality mark and a comment. These are implemented to allow quality judgments associated with any annotation in the system.

Annotations can be added, but not erased. Unnecessary annotations will eventually be de-activated to remove them from display, but keep in the database.



= Datasets = 

 # *VOC2008* is the training and validation subset of the VOC2008 dataset.
 # *LabelMe* is a small subset of the LabelMe dataset.
