#summary How to create Amazon MTurk qualifications.

= Introduction =

Qualification is a test that the worker must take before they can work on the task.
The qualification contains three parts: question form, answer key and properties. The format of those are defined in the [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSMturkAPI/2008-08-02/ Amazon developer guide]. Qualifications are created via admin interface at {{{/admin/mturk/mturkqualificationdefinition/}}}. Once the worker takes the qualification test, they will obtain the qualification value.

Once qualification is defined, we need to create qualification requirement, which includes the reference to the qualification, the required score (use comparator=EqualTo,value=score for the exact score) and whether the requirement should be created in sandbox or in production.

= Manual steps =
 1. Create qualification definition
 1. Create qualification requirement
 1. Add qualification to the session
 1. *Manually* force creation of the qualification. {{{/mt/qualification/create/<session_code>/<qualification_requirement_name>/}}}
