= Introduction =

Session is a collection of tasks that we want to complete. The usual work flow is similar to this:
 # Create a session
 # Submit images (or other data) to the session
 # Wait for the work to complete
 # Perform grading 
   * Manually
   * Via Turk
   * Automatically
 # Adjudicate grades
 # Approve/Reject submissions
 # Request more work (for tasks with unsatisfactory results)
   * Resubmit HITs that don't have a good result
   * Repeat steps above
 # Download session results:
   * Through cv_mech_turk package in ROS
   * Through "download" section on the session dashboard.

== Creating a new session ==

In the admin interface, specify the following:
 * Session code (no underscores, please).
 * Task definition
 * Funding source (Who pays)
 * Hit Limit (How many hits are allowed maximum)
 * Task execution engine:
   * Standalone (no connection to MTurk)
   * Mturk sandbox (check "sandbox", *default*)
   * Mturk production (uncheck "sandbox")




== Creating new session in a program ==

You can create a new session as a copy of the existing session. Go to the following URL:

{{{/mt/copy_session/<from>/<to>/}}}

For example:

{{{http://vm7.willowgarage.com/mt/copy_session/gt-chowder-can-s/gt-chowder-can-copy-s/}}}

The response is either {{{"+ <session number>"}}} or {{{"- <session number> Already exists"}}}.

To get this done automatically, you can use:
 * Shell: {{{wget <url>}}} in shell
 * Matlab: {{{urlread(<url>) }}}
 * Python: 
    {{{ 
  import urllib2
  try:
        print url
        fp = urllib2.urlopen(url)
        response = fp.read()              

  except urllib2.URLError, reason:
        print reason
        return None
    }}}
