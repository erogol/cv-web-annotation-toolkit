== Summary ==

We compared 400 HITs done without qualification v.s. 400 HITs done with qualification requirement. The qualification requirement improved the overlap on average by *0.22* per bounding box of the gold standard. The plot shows overall improvement:

== Status ==

Finished. Successfully demonstrated quality improvement with qualification requirement.

== Setup ==

We run annotation of 100 images with bounding boxes of 20 Pascal VOC object categories. All 20 categories were split into 4 groups of 5 objects and each group was annotated independently. As a result, there were 400 annotation tasks in each run.

Run 1. The annotation were provided with $0.02 reward. No qualification requirement has been imposed. Minimum approval rating of 90% was required.

Run 2. Simple qualification test requirement was added. Minimum approval rating requirement was kept at 90%.

== Results ==

The improvements in quality are very significant. The number of bad submissions went significantly down at the expense of the time it took to obtain annotations.

The overall improvement is *0.22* overlap score per bounding box. The number of quality submissions is significantly improved:

The same distribution can be seen in a histogram form:

The improvement for seems to happen at all levels of the bounding box size. However, the overlap score for small boxes is smaller than for larger boxes.
