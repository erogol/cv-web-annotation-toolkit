= Submission limits =

Evaluation server limits the number of submissions to a particular challenge in some unit of time. Each challenge has its own number of submissions and its own time interval.

To set up the limits, edit the challenge from the administration challenge administration interface {{{/admin/evaluation/challenge/}}}. Set "Limit in N days" and "Limit to N submissions". These limits will apply to all users regardless of the superuser status.

Exemptions are assigned explicitly to a single user for a specific challenge, period of time and for a specific number of allowed submissions. The default exemption grants *2 submissions in a 1 week period*. To grant a default exemption, visit "all submissions page" page {{{/eval/all_submissions/}}}. The column on the right provides a link to grant the default exemption. The link may be used multiple times to grant 2*K additional submissions.

To remove or create non-default exemptions, use admin interface directly. Visit {{{/admin/evaluation/submissionexceptions/}}} and choose the exception to edit or use "add new" to remove the existing exception.
