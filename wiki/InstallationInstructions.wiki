#summary Annotation server installation instructions.

*Note:* This instructions are rough. They haven't been tested on a blank machine.

= Prerequisites =

 * mysql
 * python 2.5
 * PIL (python imaging library) for some image stuff 
 * django 1.0.2
 * boto (for Mechanical Turk integration)

= Data locations = 

Please create all these folders:

 * {{{/var/datasets/<dsname>/}}} - images (can have internal folder structure) 
 * {{{/var/datasets/tasks/}}}  - task definitions. (xml files for the annotation interface)
 * {{{/var/datasets/segmentations/}}}  - compressed segmentations storage. The bitmaps are compressed with zlib and encoded into plain text (each byte goes to two chars: 4 bits are encoded with A-P, A=0, P=15).

= Django server installation = 

 * Get the source code from the SVN (from code/django/web_annotations_server). 
 * Get http://vision.cs.uiuc.edu/~largescale/js.tgz and unpack it into {{{code/django/web_annotations_server/mturk/code/}}}. I'd love to have it in the SVN, but the licenses are a mess.
 * Look into settings.py and set DJ_CODE_RT, DATASETS_ROOT
 * Create mysql user and database listed in settings.py. Grant all permissions to the user on the specified database.
 * Do: {{python2.5 manage.py syncdb}}} 
 * Do: {{python2.5 manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8080}}}
 * Go to: http://127.0.0.1/admin/
