#summary Server installation guide.

= Introduction =

This is a very rough installation guide. I hopefully lists all dependencies.

= Details =

 * Install Django 1.0.2
 * mysql
 * check out the code (web_annotations_server)
   * Put the code in /var/django
   * Create /var/datasets

 * create user and database for django. Write them to settings.py
 * Install django-tagging  (for django 1.0.2)
 * Install python-mysqldb 
 * Install django-registration
   * Install python-setuptools
   * Run easy_install django-registration
 * Install Boto (for Amazon MTurk access)
 * Install a local smtp server (to e-mail things from python)
 * Enable appropriate applications (mturk contains some templates used by other apps).
 * Run syncdb: {{{python manage.py syncdb}}}

 * Download required javascripts into web_annotations_server/mturk/code/js/:
   * [http://vm7.willowgarage.com/code/all_js.tgz all_js.tgz]


 * [optional] Run development server: {{{python manage.py runserver <host>:8080}}}

== Installing into Apache ==

This is probably wrong, but it does what I want. A better way to do it is to have a single virtual site for django.

 * Install mod-python (apt-get install libapache2-mod-python)
 * Put django.conf into /etc/apache2/conf.d/.
   * Edit it: change python paths; Correct the alias for /media. 
   * Enable/disable other configs
 * Include django.conf into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
{{{
Include /etc/apache2/conf.d/django.conf
}}}
 * sudo apache2ctl restart
